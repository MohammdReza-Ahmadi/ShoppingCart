This software is implemented based on AOP so that I can handle errors and logs in the pipeline using mediatR. However, this architecture is only created based on this software, and if it is for a larger system, mediatr itself may cause  It should be loaded in the system, and in order to see the logs, both seq and promteous.net are used for error detection and alerts are not set, and easy gashing is set to detect the deserts in the pipeline, and a test for fake data is set.  The class is created and available for products from id one to seven.
